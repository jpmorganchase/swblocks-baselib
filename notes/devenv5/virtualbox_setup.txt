* Mouse integration not working in VBox; see this:
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/500062/virtualbox-centos-vm-cant-get-mouse-to-work-on-install
Same happened to me. Eventually I found a solution on the internet that worked for me: In the machine
setting on the System menu, set the pointing device to USB tablet instead of the default PS/2 Mouse.

* Create partitions manually: 1) swap 4 GB and 2) root as ext4 (not LVM)

To install the virtualbox guest additions on Ubuntu 16.04:

sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms

On some systems the vboxsf kernel module is not yet loaded at the time fstab is read on boot. It may
then help to append the vboxsf kernel module to /etc/modules

create /media/<mount_point> and add permissions to it:

sudo mkdir /media/<mount_point>
sudo chown user:user /media/<mount_point>

share your git folder on the virtual box side and add the following line in /etc/fstab:

<vboxsf_share_name>  		/media/<mount_point>  	vboxsf 	defaults 	0 0

The following commands have to be run in on *non-windows* virtual box VMs to avoid
a possible 'Host not found (authoritative)' issue;

"c:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxManage.exe" modifyvm [VM name] --natdnshostresolver1 on
"c:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxManage.exe" modifyvm [VM name] --natdnsproxy1 on

*Note* that you should not do this on Windows VMs otherwise you may get the following issue:
