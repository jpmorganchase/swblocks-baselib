# these instructions assume that the CI_ENV_ROOT is set and the init env script is already sourced:
. $CI_ENV_ROOT/scripts/ci/ci-init-env.sh

swblocks-baselib has some other dependencies (usually headers file only) which
can be deployed directly

****************************** json-spirit 4.08 ******************************

this library is not in development since May-10-2014

the original code can be obtained from code project:

https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/20027/JSON-Spirit-A-C-JSON-Parser-Generator-Implemented

however downloading from this location requires login... alternatively it can be downloaded
from some forks created on github - e.g. the following one:

https://github.com/png85/json_spirit

once downloaded just xcopy the code under $DIST_ROOT_DEPS3/json-spirit/4.08/source
optionally the original zip can be placed under $DIST_ROOT_DEPS3/json-spirit/4.08/zip

# optional - once deployed make the deployed artifacts read only
# change owner to root and then change permissions...

sudo chown -R root:root $DIST_ROOT_DEPS3/json-spirit/
sudo chmod -R a-w $DIST_ROOT_DEPS3/json-spirit/
sudo chmod -R ug+rwx $DIST_ROOT_DEPS3/json-spirit/
sudo chmod -R a+rx $DIST_ROOT_DEPS3/json-spirit/

****************************** eclipse neon.2 ******************************

This is not a real dependency of the code, but it is important part of the devenv for
productivity reasons

Just extract Eclipse Neon.2 into $DIST_ROOT_DEPS3/eclipse/... and add CDT to it

$DIST_ROOT_DEPS3/eclipse/neon-2-jee-cdt-linux/
$DIST_ROOT_DEPS3/eclipse/neon-2-jee-cdt-macosx/

Note that eclipse requires Java, so you may have to install Java before that if it
is not installed already

Then optionally make it read only:

sudo chown -R root:root $DIST_ROOT_DEPS3/eclipse/
sudo chmod -R a-w $DIST_ROOT_DEPS3/eclipse/
sudo chmod -R ug+rwx $DIST_ROOT_DEPS3/eclipse/
sudo chmod -R a+rx $DIST_ROOT_DEPS3/eclipse/

****************************** other permissions ******************************

To just remove write access without changing the owner to root:

chmod -R uga-w $DIST_ROOT_DEPS3/
